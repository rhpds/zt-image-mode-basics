Welcome to this lab experience for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The system displayed beside this text is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
system registered with Subscription Manager.

Image mode uses standard container tools to define, build, and transport
bootc images. Podman has already been installed on this host as a build
environment, along with some additional files and required images.

[!NOTE] If you see an error related to authentication like the one
below, you can use the `+reglogin+` command provided to log into the Red
Hat Container Registry and re-run the command.

== Examine the containerfile

Switch to the link:tab-1[button label="`Containerfile`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] tab.

Click on `+Containerfile+`.

Image mode uses standard Containerfiles for defining the OS contents.

[arabic]
. The `+FROM+` line defines the base image, in this case our new
`+bootc+` base images, not a typical UBI application base image.
. The `+ADD+` line allows us to add the complete contents of a directory
at once, just like an application container.
. The `+RUN+` directives add software and start services, just like an
application container.

Unlike an application container, we’re using `+systemctl+` to enable the
service rather than an `+ENTRYPOINT+` or a `+CMD+` directive. These
images will become hosts, so these configuration directives used by
container engines for launching processes don’t apply. We will have
`+systemd+` running as PID1 once booted.

Once you are done examining the Containerfile, click on the
link:tab-0[button label="`Terminal`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"] tab.

== Examining the configurations added

We have a set of files we want to add to `+/etc+` on the host to affect
system configuration. Let’s have a quick look at one of those.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat etc/sudoers.d/wheel
----

We’re using a drop-in file to apply a NOPASSWD rule to the `+wheel+`
group. This is just one example of how you can set policies within an
image build.

[source,nocopy]
----
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL
----

== Build and push the container to the registry

Image mode uses OCI standard container tools to build bootc images, like
any other application container. Let’s build this image with
`+podman build+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman build -t [[ Instruqt-Var key="CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT" hostname="rhel" ]]/test-bootc .
----

Once built, bootc images use OCI standard container registries for
distribution. We are using a simple registry in this lab, but enterprise
registries will provide ways to inspect contents, history, manage tags
and more.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman push [[ Instruqt-Var key="CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT" hostname="rhel" ]]/test-bootc
----

This is really all that is needed for a simple web server! We can add
any common administrative or application software to our images, just
like any other RHEL host. Let’s see how we move from build to deploy in
the next exercise.
